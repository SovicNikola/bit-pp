            <acronym title="Associazione Calcio Milan">AC Milan</acronym> (Italian pronunciation: [assotʃatˈtsjoːne ˈkaltʃo ˈmiːlan]), commonly referred to as A.C.
            Milan or simply Milan, is a professional football club in Milan, Italy, founded in 1899.[3][4] The club has spent
            its entire history, with the exception of the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons, in the top flight of Italian football,
            known as Serie A since 1929–30.[3]
            <em>With 18 officially recognised UEFA and FIFA titles,</em> they are the fourth most successful club in the world,
            along with Boca Juniors, and the most successful Italian club at international level.[5][6][7][8] Milan has won
            a joint record three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup,[8] seven European Cup/Champions League
            titles (Italian record),[8] the UEFA Super Cup a joint record five times and the Cup Winners ' Cup twice.[8]
            With 18 league titles, Milan is the joint-second most successful club in Serie A, along with local rivals Internazionale
            and behind Juventus (33).[9] They have also won the Coppa Italia five times, and the Supercoppa Italiana seven.[8]
            Milan's home games are played at San Siro, also known as the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The stadium, which is shared
            with city rivals Internazionale, is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of 80,018.[10] Inter
            are considered their biggest rivals, and matches between the two teams are called Derby della Madonnina, which
            is one of the most followed derbies in football.[11]

        </p>
        <p>The former owner of the club was former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who owned the club for 31 years.
            <hr/> The club is one of the wealthiest in Italian and world football.[12]
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan"></blockquote> It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe 's leading football clubs as well
            as its replacement, the European Club Association.[13] Contents </p>
